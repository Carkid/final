            <h4>Goal 17 is about revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda is
                universal and calls for action by all countries – developed and developing – to ensure no one is left
                behind. It requires partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society. The
                Sustainable Development Goals can only be realized with a strong commitment to global partnership and
                cooperation.

                    <li> Enhance policy coherence for sustainable development</li>
                    <li> By 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable
                        development that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical
                        capacity-building in developing countries</li>
